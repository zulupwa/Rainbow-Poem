Intro to Blockchain Development Notes

LEARN HOW TO BUILD A BLOCKCHAIN APPLICATION

1.Intro:
P2P education platform
Why You Should Learn about Blockchain Technology?
-took about 30 years for the internet to show its true potential we see today.
-it's the future of collaboration: a way to create code that fucntions as a contract. Enables to trust collaborators all over the world.

What is the Bitcoin blockchain:
-it is a ledger (database of transactions) where every tx is noticed
-book of transactions of bitcoin tx that are happening
-this ledger is then stored on every node/computer that is in the bitcoin network
-only way to enter new tx (build new blocks)is through Proof of Work
-no one person can change the transaction

2.Smart Contract Developement:
What is a SC?
-code that is written on the blockchain.
-on bitcoin only tx ares tored on the bitcoin network
-on other blockchains eg ethereum, polkadot, solana, celo etc it is not only tx that are stored but also code can be stored and executed on the blockchain network.
-Nick Szabo: invented the term
-Vending machine analogy.
-eg. Alice Bob, want to bet that it'll snow on a particluar day (1 Jan)Bob bets yes, Alice bets no.In the normal world you'd need a notary to formalise the contract.On-chain you'd employ a smart contract that eliminates the trust aspect as the contract will perofrm certain tx provided that the conditions are met.eg;if it doesn't snow on a particular day, the the SC will execute tx as stipulated on on the contract, and pays Alice.



3.Dapp Development:
-decentralized application
-expensive to store data on the blockchain so only store sensitive data

DAPP Struture
front-end --{  }
	  --{  }-- Smart contract: connection to the front end, runs on blockchain
Blockchain--{  }

DAPP Attributes
-transparent programs
-immutable public database (can't be changed)
-slow and expensive(needs to be executed along the whole network)
